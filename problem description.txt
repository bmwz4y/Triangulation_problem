Triangulation problem: Write a parallel algorithm to compute the number of triangles in an 
undirected graph using MPI. First use np = 1 and then np=20 and calculate the speedup. Each 
process computes the triangles in N nodes. The format of the input file is as in the following:
Example: this sample file has 2 triangles.
0  1
0    2
0    3
1    2
2    3
2    4
3    5
4    5
Submit:
• A soft copy of your code and sample execution runs (screenshots) showing the following:
1-  The execution time and speedup to perform the task using np=1 and np =20
